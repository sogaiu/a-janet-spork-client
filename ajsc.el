;; Keywords: janet, spork, network socket repl

;;; Commentary:

;; A Janet Spork Client - Janet REPL interaction via Spork

;;;; Installation

;; Ensure this file and the following dependencies (and their
;; dependencies) are in your load-path:
;;
;;   smartparens
;;
;;  and put this in your relevant init file:
;;
;;    (require 'ajsc)
;;
;;  Optionally, add:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'janet-mode-hook
;;              #'ajsc-interaction-mode)
;;
;;  for editor features to be enabled when visiting a buffer with janet
;;  code in it

;;;; Usage

;; 0. Start Janet's Spork repl and note the host and port, e.g.
;;    in spork's directory:
;;
;;      janet -e '(import ./spork/netrepl) (netrepl/server)'

;; 1. Connect to the repl by:
;;
;;      M-x ajsc
;;
;;    and at the prompt, confirm or modify a host and port like:
;;
;;      localhost:9365
;;
;;    i.e. a host or ip address followed by a colon and port number
;;
;;    A buffer for interaction with the spork repl should appear.

;; 2. Open a Janet source file in another buffer and:
;;
;;      M-x ajsc-interaction-mode
;;
;;    (If janet-mode is enabled and appropriate configuration was
;;     performed as described in the Installation section, manually
;;     invoking `ajsc-interaction-mode` should not be necessary.)
;;
;;    There should be a Ajsc menu containing some convenience commands:
;;
;;      Send buffer
;;      Send expression at point
;;      Send region
;;
;;      Switch to REPL

;; X. Don't use the `comint-delete-output` command.  It may cause
;;    problems.

;;;; Issues

;; 1. @[] and friends are not detected appropriately (by smart-parens?)
